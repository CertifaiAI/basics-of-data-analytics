    "\n",
    "It is evident that an `ndarray` is a table of elements (you can imagine them as a spreadsheet). One caveat is that all of them are of the same data type (it is float in the example). They are indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers, which corresponds to the respective dimension. Another name for dimensions in `numpy` are axes.\n",

    "In the example above, the array has 2 axes. The first axis (rows) has a length of 2 because there are two elements (rows) in that dimension. On the other hand, the second axis (columns) has a length of 3 because there are three elements (columns) in that dimension.\n",
