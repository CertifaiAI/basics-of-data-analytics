## Guidelines to Use This Repo

1. Ensure that you have **Anaconda** or **Miniconda** installed in your system.
2. Clone this repo into your local machine.

    >   Alternatively, you may just "Download as a zip"

3. Create a new `conda` environment using `environment.yml`. Use this [guide](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file) if you need help.

4. Activate the environment and start a Jupyter Notebook instance.
5. Every package folder (Eg: Numpy) has an *"Exercise"* folder and a *"Solution"* folder. Follow along the notebooks in the *"Exercise"* folder. 

    >   But if you couldn't resolve certain exercises or tasks within those notebooks, refer to the solution counterpart of that notebook located in the *"Solution"* folder (has the same file name).
