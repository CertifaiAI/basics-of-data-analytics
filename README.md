## Guidelines to Use This Repo

1. Ensure that you have [**Anaconda**](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) or [**Miniconda**](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed in your system.
2. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository) this repo into your local machine.

    >   Alternatively, you may just "Download ZIP" and unzip the folder locally.

3. Create a new `conda` environment using `environment.yml`. Use this [guide](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file) if you need help.

4. Activate the environment `basics-of-data-analytics` and start Jupyter Notebook from `~/basics-of-data-analytics`.
5. Every package folder (Eg: Numpy) has an *"Exercise"* folder and a *"Solution"* folder. Follow along the notebooks in the *"Exercise"* folder. 

    >   But if you couldn't resolve certain exercises or tasks within those notebooks in the *"Exercise"* folder, refer to the solution counterpart of that notebook located in the *"Solution"* folder (has the same file name)<br/>
    >   Eg: `Numpy/exercise/01 - NumPy ndarray.ipynb` -> `Numpy/solution/01 - NumPy ndarray.ipynb`
